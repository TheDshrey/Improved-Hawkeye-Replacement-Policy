This project explores different possible methods of improving hawkeye using various Software and Hardware Improvement techniques. 
The main focus was to reduce miss latency and also improve the Instructions per Cycle which was Achieved by effective
Cache Partitioning and improved rrip system.
In our project to enhance Hawkeye, our primary aim was to optimize its performance in terms of Instructions per Cycle (IPC) and hit rate. 
To achieve this, we focused on refining the existing Hawkeye design. Our initial approach involved improving the 
OPTgen (Optimal Prediction Generator) component.
We explored two avenues:
● Enhancing the OPTgen vector implementation
● Refining the sampled cache mechanism.
